### Here are some guidelines I adhere to when I programme in Python.
1. Establish unique environments for every project.
2. When writing in Python, use [Snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
3. Separate the constant values in a project's constants.py file.
4. Store secret credentials in [.env](https://dev.to/jakewitcher/using-env-files-for-environment-variables-in-python-applications-55a1) files.
